This page, as the tile suggests, is all about me.

If you are reading this then you are probably new here which is awesome so welcome.

**_So who am I?_** <br>
I know, such a deep question for one so young but none the less must be answered. I am a teenage coder, high schooler, reader, learner, music listener, photographer, kinda web dev and sleeper.

**_Thats cool but what have you done?_**<br>
Well I made this site. I also maintain [autoCrat][autoCrat] a Google sheets add-on. I'm in the process of organizing [TeenTech NY][ttny] a global tech conference, for teens by teens (I also built that site). And you know go to school coz high schooler... duh.

**_Ok, Ok, fine. But whats all this for?_**<br>
Well this is going to be a blog/ tutorial/ portfolio/ who knows what else.
